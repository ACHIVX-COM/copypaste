# ACHIVX Copypaste

ACHIVX Copypaste is a tool for finding similar texts among large collections of documents.
It can work either with an in-memory storage to search among smaller collections of documents or with a MongoDB-based storage for larger, persistent collections of documents.
Additional storage types can be added as well.
